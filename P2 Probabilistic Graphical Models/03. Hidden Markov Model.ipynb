    "Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to describe a Markov process with hidden unknown parameters. Its characteristic is that it contains two sequences: observation and state. The observation sequence is visible, while the state sequence is invisible or hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "HMM typically consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.States**: The states in HMM are hidden and not directly observable. For example, in weather forecasting, the status can be `Rainy` and `Sunny`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Observations**: These are what we can directly observe. For example, activities under the influence of weather can be `Walk`, `Shop`, and `Clean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Initial Probability Distribution**: Refers to the probability that the system is in a certain state at the initial moment. For example, at the beginning, there is a 60% chance of being `Rainy` and a 40% chance of being `Sunny`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Transition probabilities**: Refers to the probability of transitioning from one state to another. For example, the probability of transitioning from `Rainy` to `Sunny` is 30%, and the probability of maintaining `Rainy` from `Rainy` is 70%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.Emission probabilities**: Refers to the probability that a certain state generates an observation value. For example, the probability of taking a `Walk` in `Rainy` state is 10%, the probability of `Shop` is 40%, and the probability of `Clean` is 50%."
