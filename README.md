## About the Notebook

### Modules
This notebook is structured into these main modules: `P1 Deep Learning`
- In `P1 Deep Learning`, the classic models/networks like MLP, CNN, ResNet, ViT will be introduced. And train them on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. We will get 94.5% accuracy on CIFAR10 with ResNet by end-to-end training. For CIFAR100, we will get 79.1% accuracy with Wide_ResNet50 which is pre-trained.

### Content
The notebook is provided in `ipynb` format, compatible with Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Each file contains a comprehensive topic and a corresponding small project for practical understanding.

### Environment
To replicate the environment, follow these simple steps:
```bash
conda create -n 3dv python=3.8
conda activate 3dv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
