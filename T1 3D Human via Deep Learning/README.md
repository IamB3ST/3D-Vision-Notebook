# 3D Human via Deep Learning

Before start learning the `T1 3D Human via Deep Learning`, you need to download the required datasets to run the project successfully.<br>
For chapter1 `2D Single-human Pose`, you need to download the MPII dataset from [here](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/).

After all datasets downloading, your `dataset` folder should be:
```
|-- T1 3D Human via Deep Learning
|   |-- dataset  
|   |   |-- MPII
|   |   |   |-- images
|   |   |   |   |-- ...
|   |   |   |-- 
```
